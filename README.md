# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The train and test set are from Kaggle, and the gender_submission.csv shows how the format of a sample submission on Kaggle should look like. The submission.csv is the actual file submitted to Kaggle, which contains only the passenger ID and whether a passenger survived or not (0 - didn't survive, 1 - survived).
